# Hostel Preferences at KNUST — Undergraduate Project Work

## Overview

This repository documents the full workflow—from data collection to analysis and modeling—for a comparative study exploring on-campus vs. off-campus hostel preferences among undergraduate students at KNUST.

## Repository Structure

- **`Questionnaire_on_Hostel_Preferences_Among_Undergraduate_Students_at_KNUST_-_all_versions_-_labels_-_2.xlsx`**  
  The original survey instrument with question versions and variable labels.

- **`Cleaned_hostel_dataset.csv`**  
  The processed dataset, cleaned and formatted for analysis.

- **`Data Preparation Notebook.ipynb`**  
  Demonstrates data ingestion, cleaning, recoding, and dataset creation.

- **`EDA Notebook.ipynb`**  
  Conducts exploratory analyses with visualizations and summary statistics.

- **`Model Training notebook.ipynb`**  
  Details the predictive modeling techniques used to analyze drivers of hostel preference.

- **Mapping Resources:**
  - `hostels_coordinates.csv`: Geographical coordinates for hostel locations.
  - `Maps Hostels in KNUST Area.qgz`: QGIS project file for spatial visualization.
  - `Hostels in KNUST Area.png`: Static map showing hostel distribution around KNUST.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Understand the survey structure** by reviewing the questionnaire file.
2. Open **`Data Preparation Notebook.ipynb`** to see how raw responses were transformed into the cleaned dataset.
3. Proceed to **`EDA Notebook.ipynb`** for demographic analyses, preference breakdowns, and visual insights.
4. Explore **`Model Training notebook.ipynb`** for inferential modeling approaches and results.
5. Use the mapping files to explore hostel locations and spatial relationships.

## Objective

To provide a transparent, reproducible workflow—from dataset to insights—highlighting how accommodation type relates to student satisfaction, academic experience, and choice reasoning among KNUST undergraduates.
